# streamlit-cheat-sheet
A cheat sheet for streamlit

# versioning
* based on streamlit 0.65.1
* made with python 3.8.5

# Requirements
The requirements.txt file looks long.
However, it is a clean venv with just pip and then streamlit.
It should therefore be the most parsimonious set of reqts for streamlit to run.
